Hello, I'm Bob and I'm excited to bring you an entirely serverless site, that itself is powered by an entirely serverless Content Management System (CMS). This means you can host a website for literally pennies, that is more secure and more scalable OOTB than anything from a conventional CMS (Wordpress etc), and still has a nice user friendy interface for someone to add content and generally build the site.

The only downside this site has is if you try and use it for very image heavy sites you may want to either change the Static Site Generator I am using from Gatsby to Hugo, or pay to use Gatsby Cloud Build to accelerate it. I've tried my best with various caching techniques, but it's just a weakness with this approach. Any suggestions and contributions welcome.
